# TinyApp
## Description:
This is tiny application, at the time start the application I crawed restaurant data from [this page](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurants-g293951-Malaysia.html). Then I parsed & saved data to sql server db. Then I create front-end application(reactjs application) to consume the api with data above. I used IdentityServer4 to handle authenication for the APIs.
